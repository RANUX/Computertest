# Computertest

A ComputerCraft-inspired mod for Minetest!

## TODO
- This code is sandboxed have access only to a turtle class/interface
- Perhaps have an "Upload Code" button
  - Code stored in turtle 
  - Add security so only people with code-uploading privileges can upload code
- Terminal would be like "Upload Code" but only one line
- Turtle can:
  - Mine blocks
      - Items go into its inventory 
  - Dump into chests
  - Require fuel
