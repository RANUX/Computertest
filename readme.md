# Computertest
A ComputerCraft-inspired mod for Minetest!
## TODO
 - Some way to upload code to turtles
   - Perhaps have an "Upload Code" button 
       - Puts code into some file in the mod
       - Add security so only people with certain upload code privilege can upload code
   - Terminal would be like "Upload Code" but only one line
   - This code would have access only to a turtle class/interface
